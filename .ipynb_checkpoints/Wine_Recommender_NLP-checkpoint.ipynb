       "[\"aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. the palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.\",\n",
       " 'pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. the palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.',\n",
       " \"much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.\",\n",
       " 'blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. in the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.',\n",
       " \"here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. it's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.\",\n",
       " \"this has great depth of flavor with its fresh apple and pear fruits and touch of spice. it's off dry while balanced with acidity and a crisp texture. drink now.\",\n",
       " 'soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this cabernet, supported by 15% merlot. coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.',\n",
       " \"baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. a compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.\",\n",
       " 'raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. this has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. a flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.',\n",
       " 'desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked tinto fino. flavors of clove and woodspice sit on top of blackberry fruit, then hickory and other forceful oak-based aromas rise up and dominate the finish.',\n",
       " 'ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. the palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.',\n",
       " 'delicate aromas recall white flower and citrus. the palate offers passion fruit, lime and white peach with a hint of mineral alongside bright acidity.',\n",
       " 'this wine from the geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. the flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice.',\n",
       " 'aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans. firm but drying tannins provide the framework.',\n",
       " 'oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.',\n",
       " 'pretty aromas of yellow flower and stone fruit lead the nose. the bright palate offers yellow apple, apricot, vanilla and delicate notes of lightly toasted oak alongside crisp acidity.',\n",
       " 'aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. the palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins.',\n",
       " 'red cherry fruit comes laced with light tannins, giving this bright wine an open, juicy character.',\n",
       " \"merlot and nero d'avola form the base for this easy red wine that would pair with fettuccine and meat sauce or pork roast. the quality of the fruit is clean, bright and sharp.\",\n",
       " 'part of the extended calanìca series, this grillo-viognier blend shows aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine, backed by touches of cut grass and wild sage. in the mouth, it shows ripe yellow-fruit flavors.',\n",
       " 'rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. made from cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon.',\n",
       " 'as with many of the erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. the notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. the fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.',\n",
       " 'this concentrated cabernet offers aromas of cured meat, dried fruit and rosemary. barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce flavors give the wine a bold, chewy feel.',\n",
       " 'inky in color, this wine has plump aromas of ripe fruit, blackberry jam and rum cake. on the palate, it is soft and smooth.',\n",
       " 'part of the natural wine movement, this wine is made from organic grapes, and the label is printed with vegetable ink on recycled paper. the quality of fruit is very nice, with a juicy palate and a bright berry flavor on the finish.',\n",
       " 'this is a festive wine, with soft, ripe fruit and acidity, plus a red berry flavor.',\n",
       " 'right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. the texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish. an eccentric blend of 50% tannat, 35% petit verdot and 15% pinotage.',\n",
       " 'spicy, fresh and clean, this would pair with fried seafood or spaghetti con vongole. it offers pretty citrus tones followed by a drying mineral nuance.',\n",
       " \"soft and fruity, this is a generous, ripe wine that's full of juicy red-cherry fruits and gentle tannins. it has some richness, giving a sweet character to this open, ready-to-drink wine.\",\n",
       " \"this blend of nero d'avola and syrah opens with savory aromas of cured meat, dried berry, cassis, tobacco and wet earth. there's a touch of almond bitterness on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'the monica grape often shows a rustic or raw quality, with aromas of cherry cola, black pepper and sour fruit. this expression does just that, with an added touch of bright acidity on the finish.',\n",
       " 'fruity and lightly herbaceous, this has fine textured acidity along with a pink grapefruit flavor. the wine is bright and easy, and it will be ready to drink in a few months.',\n",
       " \"a blend of nero d'avola and nerello mascalese, this delivers forest berry and cola, with blue flower and dusty mineral accents. the palate is easy, bright and lean.\",\n",
       " \"this shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. the mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.\",\n",
       " \"there's a touch of toasted almond at the start, but then this grillo revs up in the glass to deliver notes of citrus, stone fruit, crushed stone and lemon tart. the mouthfeel is crisp and simple.\",\n",
       " 'syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather.',\n",
       " 'this densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. drink soon.',\n",
       " 'the aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice and cherry. the flavors are tart and elegant in style, with lightly gritty tannins backing them up. best suited to the dinner table.',\n",
       " \"this fat, yeasty champagne is comprised predominantly of pinot noir. it has ripe red berry fruit, light acidity and a soft, creamy aftertaste. it's ready to drink.\",\n",
       " 'there are intriguing touches to the nose of this bottling, with jasmine, sea salt, wet hay, quinine and rainy sidewalk. the structure on the sip is quite delicate, with golden apple and honey flavors.',\n",
       " 'a blend of merlot and cabernet franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. the plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes.',\n",
       " 'this cooperative, based in aÿ, has benefited from the fine pinot noir in the village to produce a ripe red fruited wine. with balanced acidity and a soft aftertaste, it is ready to drink.',\n",
       " \"big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds.\",\n",
       " 'aromas of black-skinned fruit, leather, underbrush, game and a briny note all carry over to the lean, somewhat disjointed palate along with suggestions of licorice and raw red cherry. grainy tannins leave a drying finish.',\n",
       " \"juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness.\",\n",
       " \"this is the producer's first release of this wine. fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.\",\n",
       " 'this is made from equal parts cabernet franc and merlot, with small additions of malbec. juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.',\n",
       " 'this medium-bodied chardonnay features aromas of pineapple and roasted cashew. similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. drink now.',\n",
       " \"some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. it's fruity and undemanding. drink up.\",\n",
       " \"this fruity, sweet wine is immediately attractive and ripe. with its great apricot and pineapple fruit, hints of spicy wood and balancing acidity, it's perfect as an apéritif—light and refreshing. drink now.\",\n",
       " \"pale copper in hue, this wine exudes passion fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers nuances of muskmelon as well. it's crisp, racy and medium in body, perfectly suited to summertime refreshment. drink now.\",\n",
       " 'a healthy addition of 13% petite sirah provides added weight and intensity to this wine, a soft, supple and richly conceived combination of smoky black fruit and mocha.',\n",
       " 'softened tannins surround a light-bodied, lean and herbal approach to this vineyard-designate, dotted in black pepper, leather and baked cherry.',\n",
       " \"subdued aromas of french oak, toast and acacia waft out of the glass. the rather lean palate offers oak-driven spice, chopped herb and a hint of citrus set against racy acidity. it's rather shy on fruit richness.\",\n",
       " \"this blend of sangiovese, malbec, cabernet sauvignon, petite sirah and other varieties plays well to type. it shows a wealth of ripe, dusty black fruit that's richly round and soft on the palate, approachable and lightly oaked.\",\n",
       " \"all red bordeaux varieties are represented in this blend, except for petit verdot. together, they offer a simple tannic structure that strengthens a chewiness of leather, tobacco and a touch of cedar. full bodied, it's a ripe, bold and brawny wine.\",\n",
       " 'barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of creamsicle and baking spice. the palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. it provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times.',\n",
